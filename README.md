# Surfs Up
Present weather data to W. Avy for investing in surf and shake shop in Hawaii

## Overview of the analysis: 
To open a shop called Surf 'n' Shake, a store for surf gear and ice cream, we require investor backing. A potential investor, W. Avy, is very interested in this store and would like more insights, specifically into weather data. W. Avy has previous experience with a surf shop, where the rain made the business go under, which is why he is asking for analysis regarding the weather of Oahu. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:

Looking at the summary statistics above, we can make the following observations:
- On average, temperatures in June looks to be a little less than 4°F higher than in December. 
- Since the mean and median in both summaries are similar, there appear to be few extreme outliers in the data set that could skew the data. This also suggests both data sets are normal distributions, centering around the median.
- December has a larger range (27°, vs 21° in June) as well as a larger standard deviation. This means that December is more difficult to predict the temperature for than June.

## Summary: 
Though there are slight differences in temperature between the two months, they are largely similar. No extremely cold weather that would deter surfers or individuals looking for a scoop of ice cream. Looking at just these two month, W. Avy might believe that the shop will be successful year round. I do believe that this segmentation may not be giving us all of the details. Just looking at the information available to us already, it could be beneficial to look at the precipitation data as well as group the data by station ID. Precipitation may have more of a hinderance on surfers than temperature - if it is pouring rain, then it may not be safe for people to be out in the ocean. Additionally, looking at the station IDs and their altitude may be beneficial. If we are opening a surf shop, the shop will likely be close to sea level. Knowing the rain totals and temperatures at the top of the island/volcano will not give us an accurate representation of the climate near the beach. I would also suggest doing a similar analysis for months year round. Hawaii is a tropical climate which means it can rain year round.

Beyond the data already available to us, it may be beneficial to look outside of these data sets and look into other things such as the below:
- Tourism - when are there more people who may need rental gear or ice cream
- Storms - when are tropical storms more likely, making surf conditions rough
- Water Temperature - more than atmospheric temperature, water temperatures may have an impact on demand
- Look more closely at what happened with W. Avy's previous endeavor - the weather, etc. may have been similar, so were there any other reasons the business wasn't successful?
