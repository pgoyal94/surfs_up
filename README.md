# Surfs Up
Present weather data to W. Avy for investing in surf and shake shop in Hawaii

## Overview of the analysis: 
To open a shop called Surf 'n' Shake, a store for surf gear and ice cream, we require investor backing. A potential investor, W. Avy, is very interested in this store and would like more insights, specifically into weather data. W. Avy has previous experience with a surf shop, where the rain made the business go under, which is why he is asking for analysis regarding the weather of Oahu. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
